OpenGeoSys (OGS) is a scientific [open source project](https://github.com/ufz/ogs) for the development of numerical methods for the simulation of thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in porous and fractured media. OGS is implemented in C++, it is object-oriented with an focus on the numerical solution of coupled multi-field problems (multi-physics). Parallel versions of OGS are available relying on both MPI and OpenMP concepts. Application areas of OGS are currently $CO_2$ sequestration, geothermal energy, water resources management, hydrology and waste deposition. OGS is comprised of the THMC-simulator (simply referred to as *OGS*) and a visualization tool (*Data Explorer*).

OGS is developed by the *OpenGeoSys Community*.
